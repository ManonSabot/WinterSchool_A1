Numbers 10 and 90 indicate the 10th percentile (cold) and 90th percentile (hot) of SST.
The seasons files are empty, they don't work!
Files with _yr.nc show the percentiles across all years (several dates)
Files with _yrs.nc show a single value which I think is the average of all dates falling in the 10th or 90th category
Files with _20rm.nc show the dates where the 20 day running mean percentile value is reached for all days in the 20 day running mean period (I think)

Can do more tomorrow...
To have a look, use plot_SST_xtremes.py
